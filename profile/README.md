# Welcome to AgentX
AgentX is the embodied agent research group from X Lab, Agibot, dedicated to advancing the frontiers of artificial intelligence and robotics. 
Our work focuses on creating an AI-native intelligent system that interacts with the world in a human-like way.

## What We Do
- **Planning**: A multi-arm system solves long-horizon problems in the open world.
- **Memory**: enables robots to remember who you are, and learn from human demonstrations and failures. 
- **Actions**: learn a universal action representation for different embodies.
- **Interaction**: interruption mechanism during conversation and action execution, task priority automation, etc. 
- **Multi-agent**: let multiple robots collaboratively solve problems.
- **Benchmark**: benchmark the performance of SOTA multimodal LLMs for embodied agents.
- **Simulation Environment**: A lightweight playground for agents to learn how to plan and memorize.
